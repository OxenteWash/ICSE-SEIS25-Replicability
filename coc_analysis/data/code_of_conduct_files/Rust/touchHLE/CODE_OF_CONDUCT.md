# touchHLE code of conduct

## General

Please be kind and respectful to others.

It's especially important to value and respect others' time and energy: don't demand or expect anything to happen on any particular timescale, or even for anyone to do anything at all. We're all volunteers here, doing things for the love of it, and if you force us to spend a lot of time on _you_ without a good reason, it's going to slowly chip away at our passion and enthusiasm.

I do not feel like a full-length, corporate project-style ‚Äúcode of conduct‚Äù is necessary here, but to be absolutely clear: trans rights üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è, racists can fuck off, etc. If someone's making you uncomfortable or worse, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me directly. In any case, I reserve the right to block anyone from the project at any time for any reason, but I promise to exercise careful judgment. Thanks. ~ hikari\_no\_yume
